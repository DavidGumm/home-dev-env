1.  **Dual Mode Operation**:

    *   **Interactive Mode**: The script will prompt the user for input if no parameters are provided when it's run. This mode is ideal for users who prefer a guided approach.
    *   **Non-Interactive Mode**: The script will accept command-line arguments, allowing it to be run with pre-defined options. This mode is suitable for automated environments or for users who know exactly what they need.
2.  **Input Collection**:

    *   Collect a list of applications to be managed by WinGet.
    *   Optionally collect additional parameters for each application, such as specific versions, installation arguments, or tags (like 'dev' or 'prod').
3.  **Output Generation**:

    *   **YAML Configuration File**: Generate a WinGet YAML configuration file that can be used to manage the state of installed applications on the system.
    *   **PowerShell Script**: Generate a PowerShell (.ps1) script that contains a list of "winget install" commands for each application, including any specified arguments.
4.  **Input Validation and Error Handling**:

    *   Validate the inputs to ensure they are in the correct format and handle any errors or inconsistencies in user input gracefully.
5.  **User Guidance and Help**:

    *   Provide clear instructions and help within the script for users to understand how to use it, especially in interactive mode.
6.  **Customization and Extensibility**:

    *   Allow for easy customization and extension of the script, so it can be adapted for different environments or requirements.
7.  **Logging and Reporting**:

    *   Include logging functionality to track the actions performed by the script and report any issues or successes.
8.  **Compatibility Check**:

    *   Ensure compatibility with different versions of Windows and PowerShell, as well as with the latest version of WinGet.
9.  **Security Considerations**:

    *   Implement security best practices, particularly when handling user inputs and executing installation commands.
10.  **Documentation**:

    *   Provide a comprehensive README or documentation, explaining the script's functionality, requirements, and usage examples.
